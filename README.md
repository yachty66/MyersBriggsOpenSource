# MyersBriggs open source 

## Projects Description

Project should open source the myers briggs test. 

## Overview

- [x] create bot for https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test. bot is used for doing the test 10000 times
- [x] safe the questions answered for each test result respectively in airtable
- [ ] Use a machine learning algorithm for solving the task of predicting type based on answers. Test all of the following:
    - [x] Random Forest: Random forest is a popular algorithm for classification tasks. It is an ensemble of decision trees, where each tree is trained on a random subset of the data and a random subset of the features. This algorithm can handle non-linear relationships between the input features and the output variable.
    - [ ] Gradient Boosting: Gradient boosting is another popular algorithm for classification tasks. It works by combining weak learners (usually decision trees) to create a strong learner. This algorithm is particularly good at handling imbalanced datasets and can handle non-linear relationships between the input features and the output variable.
    - [ ] Support Vector Machines: Support vector machines (SVMs) are a popular algorithm for classification tasks. SVMs work by finding the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the two classes. SVMs are particularly good at handling high-dimensional datasets.
- [ ] create a simple react app where people can do the open source myersbriggs test 
- [ ] create a short article for the project 
- [ ] share to a few people and on social media

## Steps 

- [x] create venv for project
- [x] get all the html from https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test
- [x] click on first page everywhere agree and than click on the next button and see if this works
- [x] repeat this as often until results are coming 
- [x] implement functionality that answering of questions is random 
- [x] save each question somewhere 
- [x] put data into appropriate json format {"question 1 ": "a", "q2": 30, "result": "Proagonist"}
- [ ] create a python file data where i define a class for the date 
- [ ] implement Gradient boosting
- [ ] implement SVM 
- [ ] collect more data
