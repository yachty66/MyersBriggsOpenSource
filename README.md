# MyersBriggs open source 

## Projects Description

Project should open source the myers briggs test. 

## Overview

- [ ] create bot for https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test. bot is used for doing the test 10000 times
- [ ] safe the questions answered for each test result respectively in airtable
- [ ] Use a machine learning algorithm for solving the task of predicting type based on answers. Test all of the following:
    - Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is a binary classification algorithm that can be used to predict which personality type a person is likely to get based on their answers to the questions. It works well when the output variable (personality type) is binary (i.e., only two possible outcomes).
    - Random Forest: Random forest is a popular algorithm for classification tasks. It is an ensemble of decision trees, where each tree is trained on a random subset of the data and a random subset of the features. This algorithm can handle non-linear relationships between the input features and the output variable.
    - Gradient Boosting: Gradient boosting is another popular algorithm for classification tasks. It works by combining weak learners (usually decision trees) to create a strong learner. This algorithm is particularly good at handling imbalanced datasets and can handle non-linear relationships between the input features and the output variable.
    - Support Vector Machines: Support vector machines (SVMs) are a popular algorithm for classification tasks. SVMs work by finding the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the two classes. SVMs are particularly good at handling high-dimensional datasets.
- [ ] create a simple react app where people can do the open source myersbriggs test 
- [ ] create a short article for the project 
- [ ] share to a few people and on social media

## Steps 

- [x] create venv for project
- [ ] get all the html from https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test
